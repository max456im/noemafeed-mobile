2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable license, subject to the terms of this License, to:

(a) reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense and distribute
    its Contributions in Source Code or Executable Form; and

(b) make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer its
    Contributor Version, for any purpose.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective
for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License.
No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of
Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent
license is granted by a Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of
    Covered Software; or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software
    (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
    Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of
any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in
Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the
Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or
under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its
original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright
laws or under the terms of any applicable patent license agreements. This License
explicitly acknowledges that the exercise of rights under this License does not
constitute infringement of copyright or patent to the extent such exercise is
permitted by applicable law (including fair use, fair dealing, or other similar
doctrines).

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications
that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License.
You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is
governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License.
You may not attempt to alter or restrict recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as required
    by Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the availability of Source Code
    Form; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
    sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable
    Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code
    Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other
code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute such Larger Work as a
single product. In such a case, You must make sure that the requirements of this
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

3.4. Notices

You must ensure that any Covered Software You distribute, whether in Source Code Form
or Executable Form, retains the following notice:

    Copyright (c) 2025–2026 Maksim Zapevalov
    SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0

If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant
directory file) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may
do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it
absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation
is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
liability terms You offer.

3.5. Modifications

You may distribute Modifications in Source Code Form only under the terms of this
License. You must cause each of Your Modifications to carry prominent notices stating
that You changed the files and the date of any change. You must also include the
notice required in Section 3.4.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum
extent possible under such statute, order, or regulation; and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file
included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to
comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights
granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates
Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of
the non-compliance within 60 days after receipt of notice.

5.2. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing
basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,
and You become compliant prior to 30 days after receipt of the notice.

5.3. Termination of Your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
parties who have received copies or rights from You under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of the
Covered Software from a non-terminating party does not restore Your rights.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable,
fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary
servicing, repair, or correction.

7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or any person who distributes Covered
Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such
litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its
conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability
to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be
reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation
that provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
--------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one
other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this
License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License
under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any
subsequent version published by the license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not intended for use with the Mozilla Foundation ecosystem and
you wish to create a modified version of this License, you must rename the license
and remove any references to the Mozilla Foundation or to the unmodified license.

11. Future Licensing
-------------------

If the Covered Software includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that
do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
purposes only and do not modify the License.
